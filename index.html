Hey there, I'm Andy, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my little corner of the web! I created this site to demonstrate what I've learned in a place to put it into practice. This entire site is made up from both HTML & CSS I have manually written. It is split up into sections such as "SEO", "Project Management", Javascript<br>
<br>
Digital marketing should be logical. It should make sense to someone outside the industry. It's both disappointing and frustrating the industry is made up of "smoke & mirrors" as if it's more complex than it needs to be. The power of digital marketing comes from it's transparency and any digital marketer should be able to demonstrate value for money. <br>
<br>

To get started, click the button in the middle of the image. <br>

Once you've clicked the botton you can access the site contents via the burger menu in the top left corner of the screen. <br>

Thank you for being here, and I'm eager to explore the boundless horizons of web development and beyond with you!
